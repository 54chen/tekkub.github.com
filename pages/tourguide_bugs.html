	All bugs should be submitted to
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tekkub-wow/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=addon:TourGuide&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Addon%20Milestone%20Summary">Google Code</a>.
	Please look over the list first to make sure your issue isn't listed.
</p>

	<i><b>Please make sure you are set to receive email updates to tickets you open on GCode.</b></i>
	If I post something that needs feedback from you, and you never reply, I will close the ticket out without a second thought!
	You can turn on notifications on the <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/settings">settings page</a>.

<h2> Important info you should include </h2>
<ul>
	<li> The version you are running </li>
	<li> The version of related addons (Carto, TomTom) if the bug may relate to them </li>
	<li> The guide (zone and level) you are using </li>
	<li> The exact title of the objective (usually quest name) and the type (accept, complete, turnin, run...) </li>
	<li> What you were doing when the bug occurred </li>
</ul>

<h2> Known conflicts </h2>
<div class="wrapper">
	<p>
		There are a number of &quot;Quest Level&quot; addons that append the quest's
		recommended level to the front of the text in the quest log and other
		places. A good number of these addons do this by hooking
		GetQuestLogTitle and modifying it's return values. <i><b>This is a very bad practice</b></i>.
		The addons listed below do this, they will break TG's auto-detection,
		and I do not intend to compensate for their bad code in TourGuide. If
		you want quest levels that don't interfere I've written <a href="http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=8631">Quel'evel</a> as an alternative.

	<ul>
		<li> QuestLevel by Elkano (and the many &quot;revived&quot; versions floating around) </li>
		<li> QuestLongList by Zevzabich </li>
		<li> QuestIOn <i>Can be disabled by turning off the quest level feature</i> </li>
		<li> Extended Quest Log 3 </li>
	</ul>

<h2> Submitting patches </h2>
<div class="wrapper">
	<p>
		I have had many problems with submitted patches, they never seem to be in the correct format.
		While I will not reject patches submitted to Google Code, I much prefer you fork my github repo and push changes directly.  See below for details.
	</p>

<h2> Hot forking action! </h2>
<div class="wrapper">
	<p>
		If you know how to use git, then I really shouldn't need to tell you how to get commits to me.
		Simply fork <a href="http://github.com/tekkub/tourguide">my repo on github</a> and push to your new fork.
		You don't even have to contact me, I'll just pull the changes in as I see them come in!

Welcome to my crappy website.  I'm lazy, so you may not see many improvements to this base page.  Anywho, the good shit's below.

For lots more goodies that I haven't got on this site yet, visit <a href="http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/index.php?cid=37">My WoWInterface section</a>.

You can also find all sorts of little unreleased mods in my <a href="http://github.com/tekkub">git repos</a>.
<div class="wrapper">
<i><b>Important note:</b> addons pulled from git are <b>alpha quality</b> and are not supported, they could completely screw up your game...
but I strive for that not to happen, of course.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</i>

All the guides included with the released version of TourGuide are now "viewable online":/tg.  Print them out!  Show your friends!  And of course, install the "addon":/addons/TourGuide!

The web-based guides will be updated whenever a new version of the addon is released.
